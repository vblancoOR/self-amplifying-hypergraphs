# On the optimal growth of autocatalytic subnetworks

Python Code for the calculation of the maximum growth factor (MGF) of a chemical network

File autocatalytic_cores_lib contains all the functions for the computation of minimal autocatalytic subnetworks from a given stoichiometric matrix.

File scenario_generator contains the functions scenarioGeneratorV1 and scenarioGeneratorV2 for the creation of scenarios.

File algorithm_1 contains the function tryGrowthRateGraph that calculate the MGF of an autocatalytic network.

File algorithm_3 contains the function growthRateInSubgraphDefinitive that calculate the MGF of an autocatalytic subnetwork with the greater MGF.
